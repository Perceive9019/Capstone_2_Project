    "Airbnb has become a popular alternative to traditional hotel accommodations. With over 7 million listings worldwide, it is disruptive to the hotel industry. However, the pricing of Airbnb listings varies significantly based on a plethora of factors such as location, amenities, availability, etc. Predicting the price of Airbnb listings will help hosts to price their properties competitively and guests to choose the best options within their budget.\n"
