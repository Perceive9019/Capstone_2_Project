# Predicting San Diego Airbnb Prices
  - ***_Objective_**: Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the factors impacting the prices of Airbnb listings in San Diego.*
  - ***_Approach_**: The project employs several advanced techniques, including Random Forest Regression, XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine.*
  - ***_Tools_**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy, XGBoost, LightGBM.*
  - ***_Outcomes_**: The Airbnb prices in San Diego depend highly on the time of year and neighborhood. The highest prices are charged in the summer (August), and the most expensive neighborhoods are Gaslamp Quarter, La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and Mission Bay. The XGBoost model was the most robust predictive model because it explained 61% of the variance in the training data.*
